Taken together, these two preserves provide an excellent example of the area's geologic history and ecological systems.  The effects of ice age glaciers can be seen in the multiple waterfalls that splash down along Lick Brook on its journey to Cayuga Lake, including one that is nearly 140 feet tall.  The Sweedler and Thayer Preserves contain more than 2 miles of hiking trails on 155 acres that are part of a contiguous block of conserved lands that also include two state parks, the Land Trust's Cayuga Inlet Conservation Area, and a Cornell Botanic Gardens Natural Area.  A large portion of this landscape is covered by lofty Eastern hemlock and white pine trees, but different species of oak and maple thrive, as well as the less common cucumber magnolia and mountain maple. On a spring day, listen for the flute-like song of the hermit thrush and the black-throated green warbler, or tread softly through a fresh fallen snow to find the tracks of wild turkey, red fox or deer. The Lick Brook corridor remains a conservation priority area for the Land Trust.  The perpetual protection of this area allows ample opportunity for hiking and peaceful enjoyment of our natural world, while protecting the water quality of Cayuga Lake.",

Today, visitors can enjoy a 1.2 mile hiking trail that ends in an impressive view of the Enfield Valley.  The history of the Stevenson Preserve is visible not only as paragraphs of a deed, but also in the grandeur of its trees.  The original 25-acre parcel is a patch of undisturbed forest that is quickly becoming a rarity.  A number of the trees that create a dense canopy had their start at least 150 years ago.  Unlike their counterparts in most regions of the northeast, these trees have only a faint memory of the mass felling that occurred in the rush to turn forest to farmland.  The preserve has several vernal ponds that support a variety of aquatic life.  In early spring, it may be possible to witness the migration of spotted salamanders from their winter hideaways to the shallow water. Trail visitors will notice the white-blazed Finger Lakes Trail/North Country National Scenic Trail along the way.",
